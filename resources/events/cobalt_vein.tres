You decide to mine some of it. You take a pickaxe laying nearby, and chip away at the rock.
From time to time, sparks are flying as you strike the metal embedded within the rock.

After a minute or two, you try and collect the material, but you find out that it has changed into something different.
Altered by the essence of Embers, the Iron and Nickel have melded together into Cobalt, but the resulting substance is too impure to be useful for anything.

You leave the place, disappointed."
