description = "As you go back to the surface, you stumble on a piece of rock protruding from the floor.
Your toe hurts.
You kick it in anger and send it flying towards the opening.

As it flies, you recognize its characteristic shape and color. It is elemental Bismuth, comprised of Copper and Nickel, and treated with Embers.

However, as Light hits the piece of Bismuth, it began to dissolve into a strange, shadowy vapor.

You recognize it as elemental Darkness, but you can't collect it as is, without proper apparature.

Hastily, you collect what remained of the piece of Bismuth, and return home."
