description = "The alchemical apparata lie neatly placed along the desk.
Below them, three chambers, for three essences of creation.
On the right - the four elements. Fire, Earth, Air, and Water. All else that came to be, did so through a union of these fundamental aspects.
The secrets of synthesis are yours to uncover.
But be wary - your time is short. Limited by a foe one can't grasp, yet alone fight. The candle that illuminates your station will hold it at bay, for as long as you let it.
To your left is a map of the land. You may venture forth, and explore in search of something useful to further your aim, but be sure to stay indoors as the night falls. The shadows lie in wait for the unwary.

You may get to work right away, or take a look at the book to the left."
