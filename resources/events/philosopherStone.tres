The catalyst of transformation. The elixir of immortality. The symbol of illumination.
The Philosopher's Stone.
As you clutch the mysterious substance, you sense the ephemereal foe retreat deep into the soil, scurrying away from the illuminating influence of the stone. It will no longer touch you.
With newfound sense of safety and assurance, you leave the hut which served as your stronghold up until this moment. You don't concern yourself with the direction of your travels - that which you seek, you shall find regardless of any setback."
