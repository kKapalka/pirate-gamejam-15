For a moment, you were unsure of their intentions, however you notice the symbol on their necklace. The Squared Circle.
They are a fellow alchemist, and have recognized you as one of their kind.
\"I haven't seen you set up your station within the city,\" they say. \"You must live outside the city, no? I pity you - The surroundings might be abundant in resources, but the Shadows pose too much danger for me to bear.
Do you at least maintain your light? I hope I don't repeat myself too much, but you know you can feed your light source with your elemental essence, right?\"
They continue.
\"Here, grab this. Some sources of fuel are better than others. Hope that helps!\""
